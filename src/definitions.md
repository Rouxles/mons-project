# Key Terms and Definitions

## 51% Attack

Definition: When a person or affiliated group of people have 51% or more of the resources in the mining pool in a cryptographic system that uses proof-of-work, allowing them to manipulate the network to their own liking.

Explain: When a block is considered 'valid' on the blockchain, that fork of the blockchain needs to be the longest chain, meaning that in order to create a fraudulent block, you would need to make blocks faster than the rest of the mining pool to get your fork of the blockchain 'trusted', which requires more than 51% of the share of the mining pool and enough luck.
