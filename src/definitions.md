# Key Terms and Definitions

## 51% Attack

Definition: When a person or affiliated group of people have 51% or more of the resources in the mining pool in a cryptographic system that uses proof-of-work, allowing them to manipulate the network to their own liking.

Explain: When a block is considered 'valid' on the blockchain, that fork of the blockchain needs to be the longest chain, meaning that in order to create a fraudulent block, you would need to make blocks faster than the rest of the mining pool to get your fork of the blockchain 'trusted', which requires more than 51% of the share of the mining pool and enough luck.

## Block

Definition: A group of a fixed size of transactions from the transaction pool to be inserted into the blockchain. 

> To expand, you could say that each block has a header which contains the previous block hash, the nonce, the version that the cryptocurrency is running on in that block (so other miners know how to read it and what to do with that data), and the hash of the block.

## Blockchain

Definition: A blockchain is made up of several blocks linked to each other by using the hash of the previous block and hash of the current block such that if a single value in one of the blocks is changed, the hash changes, and thus, the chain is 'broken' and is therefore an invalid chain unless all subsequent blocks are re-validated. 

## Candidate Block

Definition: A candidate block is a block to be entered into the blockchain. This is essentially a list of transactions where the nonce hasn't been found to make the hash of the block and the nonce under a certain target value.

## Collision Resistance

Definition: A property of a cryptographic hash function where a function is considered collision resistant if it is very hard to find two inputs that map to the same output.

## Cryptocurrency

Definition: A form of digital currency that is not regulated by a central authority.

## Cryptographic Hash

Definition: A one-way function where an input maps to a unique output of fixed length and where a small change to the input creates a completely different end hash.
